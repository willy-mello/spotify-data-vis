This is just re-hacking a hackathon project I did.

## Original project

Idea originated as a poorly crafted react native app that did some dataviz.

Now its a better version as a react SPA

### how did I get here

On the shoulders of giants.<br>
Following[Jonny Kalambay's](https://medium.com/@jonnykalambay/now-playing-using-spotifys-awesome-api-with-react-7db8173a7b13) awesome guide, I finally got Spotify's API calls to work through the authorization_code authorization flow.

### What does it do?

This app lets a user log-in through spotify, then their musical taste is vizualized with react-charts.

### goals?

I want to eventually deploy it to heroku and share it with everyone out there.

### What can you do?

**Fork it and make a better version!**

I know you can do it!
